Marvel Defiance: Multiverse Madness 

What if we crossed the bounds of reality and crossed into the multiverse?
Marvel Defiance: Multiverse Madness answers that question. A turn-based fight game that has a team of three Heroes and Villains going head-to-head to secure the future of the multiverse.
The user has the option to select a team of heroes and villains or allow a computer-generated team to be selected for them. The computer will then generate an opposition team, each round, for our multiversal team to battle. 
The winner will be determined via head-to-head match ups where a twenty-sided dice is rolled, and the value determines the winner. 
The losing team will lose a fighter and whomever has the most remaining multiversal fighters, after the round wins. 
The user will complete five rounds of battle - whomever is deemed the winner by winning at minimum three out of five battles will be declared best of the multiverse. 
If the battle winner, they will advance to a screen congratulating them, if the user loses, they will advance to a screen advising them of their crushing defeat. Both results will render a scoreboard so the users can see how they stack up against other players.
The user will have the option to save the team they played with or start fresh with a new cast of characters.
